        "The BartTokenizer and BartForConditionalGeneration classes are part of the Hugging Face Transformers library, which provides state-of-the-art natural language processing models and tools. Specifically, they are used in the context of the BART (Bidirectional and Auto-Regressive Transformers) model.\n",

        "BartTokenizer is responsible for tokenizing text into subword units called tokens. It handles tasks such as splitting words into smaller units, adding special tokens like <s> (start of sequence) and </s> (end of sequence), and encoding the text into numerical representations that can be understood by the BART model.\n",
        "\n",
        "BartForConditionalGeneration is the core component of BART that performs conditional text generation. It is a transformer-based model that consists of an encoder-decoder architecture. The encoder processes the input text and encodes it into a rich representation, capturing the contextual information. The decoder takes this representation and generates the output text autoregressively, word by word, using a causal attention mechanism.\n",
        "\n",
        "By using the BartTokenizer to tokenize the input and then feeding the tokenized input into the BartForConditionalGeneration model, you can perform various text generation tasks such as summarization, translation, and text completion.
